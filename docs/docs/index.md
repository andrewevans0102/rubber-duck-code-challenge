This is the user guide for the _Rubber Duck Code Challenge_ project.

The basic idea behind the _Rubber Duck Code Challenge_ project was to make learning more fun.  The project provides a basic game where players compete to gain points for learning activities.  Whenever you do a learning activity, just record it in the app and you'll get points.  

__Learning Activities__ include the following:

- Read Article
- Wrote Blog Post
- Listened to Podcast
- Watched Video
- Attended Lecture
- Built Hello World App
- Resolved Production Issue
- Attended Meetup

## High Scores
Every Friday, the admin tallies the scores and then the winners are saved.  This is done both in a Slack Message as well as part of the __high scores__ page in the application.  If you check out the Slack Channel `high-scores` you'll see the output. 

## Activities
- The __activities__ remain in the system, so we can all refer back to them in the future.  
- Before final scores are tallied, you can delete activities you create.  
- Once the scores are tallied, all activities recorded before that date are locked.

Check out some of the basic guides here on how to get started (its very intuitive as well).

Hope you enjoy the __Rubber Duck Code Challenge__!
